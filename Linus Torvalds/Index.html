    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      Linus Torvalds, (born December 28, 1969, Helsinki, Finland), Finnish
      computer scientist who was the principal force behind the development of
      the Linux operating system. At age 10 Torvalds began to dabble in computer
      computer science student at the University of Helsinki (M.S., 1996), he
      purchased his first personal computer (PC). He was not satisfied, however,
      with the computer’s operating system (OS). His PC used MS-DOS (the disk
      operating system from Microsoft Corp.), but Torvalds preferred the UNIX
      operating system he had used on the university’s computers. He decided to
      create his own PC-based version of UNIX. Months of determined programming
      work yielded the beginnings of an operating system known as Linux. In 1991
      he posted a message on the Internet to alert other PC users to his new
      system, made the software available for free downloading, and, as was a
      common practice among software developers at the time, he released the
      source code, which meant that anyone with knowledge of computer
      programming could modify Linux to suit their own purposes. Because of
      their access to the source code, many programmers helped Torvalds retool
      and refine the software, and by 1994 Linux kernel (original code) version
      1.0 was released.
